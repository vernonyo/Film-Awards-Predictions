  10% : Problem definition based on a dataset.
  20% : Use Machine Learning tools to solve it.
  
40% for “Analytical” Components
  20% : Exploratory Analysis and Visualization.
  20% : Data-driven insights from your solution.
  
20% for “Supporting” Components
  10% : Data extraction, preparation, cleaning.
  10% : Presentation and overall impression.
  
10% for “Learning” something new (fits anywhere)

# Steps to follow:
Step 1 : Choose a dataset according to your interests.

Step 2 : Define a problem on the dataset or go with the default.

Step 3 : Figure out the proper data representation and features
         Strategies: 1. Represent the data in numeric format
                     2. Use a tailor-made "model family" in ML (E.g. Neural Networks in Natural Language Processing)
                     
Step 4 : Perform exploratory data analysis on raw/processed data.
         - Ask questions on the data and extracted features to “illustrate” your problem.
         - Which features are common? Which ones differentiate them?
         
Step 5 : Study your chosen model thoroughly before you use it.

Step 6 : Set your Model Building process.
         - **Prepare**  Train, Validation and Test Data
         - **Train**    “Fit” the Model on the Train Set
         - **Test**     “Predict” using the trained Model
         - **Evaluate** Performance “metrics” for Model       
         - Once you are happy with your final model(s), you can derive insights from the model and the entire exploratory data analysis process.
           o  Which features/properties differentiate?
           o  Which features/properties are common?
           
Splitting Workload:
1. Basic pre-processing of data (cleaned & removed outliers)
2. Exploration of dataset
3. Remodel building of dataset

1 person do the entire EDA
1 person do remodelling & pre-processing
1 person do visualisation, some new learning and help the other 2
